					<h2>Meet Lucy</h2>
				</div>
				<p>	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Welcome to my personal website! My name is Lucy Post and I am currently a junior at the University of St. Thomas. I will be graduating in May 2020 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. During my time at St. Thomas, I have most enjoyed my study abroad experiences. My freshman year I spent J-term in Italy for a theology course. This past spring, I had the chance to travel with the UST choir to Vietnam for a two week tour where we performed around the country. My last study abroad experience was this past J-term. I went to Nepal to learn about Hinduism and Buddhism. It was an eye-opening experience.</p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After I graduate, I want to be working in a full time position as a Software Developer. Last summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at Thomson Reuters. For summer 2019, I will be returning to TR for another internship.</p>
